This project is deployed on Aruba Cloud. Some reminders and tips for Aruba Cloud:

- Choose a VPS that supports IPv4.
- Install NVM to manage the latest version of Node.js.
- Open the necessary ports on the server using 'sudo ufw allow [PORT]' (e.g. 'sudo ufw allow 3000').
- Manage all the Node applications with PM2.
